This ``problem set'' is primarily to get you oriented with \LaTeX, not really to test anything. I decided to add to the content to provide some prerequisite and background revision and practice. None of this is necessary, however, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with both the LaTeX and the math content.

In many cases, the LaTeX code has been removed. Your goal is to recreate the content as closely as you can. Again, this is for your practice, not graded at all.

\newproblem{Proof Practice}{}
\begin{enumerate}[]
	\item Prove by induction that: $\forall n \in \NN,\; \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$
	\item Prove by induction that: $\forall n \in \NN,\; \sum_{i=1}^n i^3 = \left( \sum_{i=0}^{n}i \right)^2$
	\item Prove by contradiction that: $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
	\begin{enumerate}
	    \item  \begin{proof}[Proof by induction]
    		Let $P(n)$ be the statement: $\sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$
    		
    		\textbf{Base:} $P(1)$ is true since $1^2 = 1 = \frac{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3}{6}$
    		
    		\textbf{Step:} Assume $P(k)$ holds. Then:
    		$$\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i^2 = \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^{k} i^2}_{= \frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} \text{ by } P(k)} + (k+1)^2 = \cdots = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)(2k+3)}{6}$$
    		
    		Thus $P(k) \Rightarrow P(k+1)$, so by induction, $P(n)$ holds for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
	\end{proof}
        \item  I'm lazy I skipped.
        \item  \begin{proof}[Proof by Contradiction] 
            Assume that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. Then $\exists{p,q}\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $\sqrt{2}=\frac{p}{q}$ where $q\neq{}0$ and $\frac{p}{q}$ is irreducible. Now $\sqrt{2}=\frac{p}{q} \implies 2 =\frac{p^2}{q^2} \implies 2q^2=p^2 \implies$ $p^2$ is even. 
            
            Since $p^2$ is even, $p$ must be even (as the square of an odd number is odd). Thus $p = 2k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$.
            
            Substituting back: $2q^2 = p^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 \implies q^2 = 2k^2$. Therefore $q^2$ is even, which means $q$ is even.
            
            But if both $p$ and $q$ are even, they share a common factor of 2, contradicting our assumption that $\frac{p}{q}$ is irreducible.
            
            Therefore, our assumption is false, and $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
        \end{proof}

\newproblem{Miscellaneous Mathematics}{}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Define the Fibonacci numbers.
	\item What are the roots of: $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$?
	\item What is the sum of the series $a, a+d, a+2d, \dots, a+(n-1)d = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a + id = \sum_{i=1}^n a + (i-1)d$?

% You might want to try \left( \right) as well as replacing () with \{\} or with [].
% If you want to explicitly control the size of these brackets, you can look at:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fibonacci
		      \begin{align*}
		      	F_n = \begin{cases}
		      	n & n \in \set{0, 1} \\

		      \end{align*}
		\item The roots of $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are:
		      
		\item Arithmetic Series and Sums. Let $a, d \in \RR$, then the series $a, a+d, a+2d, \dots, a+(n-1)d$ for $n \in \NN$ is an arithmetic progression. It is a sequence with a common difference between consecutive terms.

		      Intermediate step is to prove by induction that:
		      % Use the \tag*{Using assumption} after writing an equation to showcase reasoning
		      % Like this:

		      % The black square is made via: \qed
		      % But it is built into the template I provide and
		      % it will appear at the end of the solution environments automatically
		      %
		      % Look at \, and \; inside math mode to play around with small spacing.
		      % If you want more spacing, look at \quad and \qquad.
		      %
		      % Text inside math mode is written using \text{Assume: } and so on.
		      % Note that we leave a space inside the \text{} command so that spacing is correct.
		      % Try dropping it to see what happens.
		      \begin{align*}
		      	% \forall n\in\NN,\; \sum_{i=0}^{n} i &= \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\

		      	% 
		      	% &= (n+1) + \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\tag*{Using assumption} \\
		      \end{align*}
		\item Geometric series and sums. For $a \in \RR$, be a real number, then the series $a, ar, ar^2, \dots, ar^{n-1}$ is a geometric progression. It is a sequence with a common ratio between consecutive terms.
		      \begin{align*}

		      \end{align*}
		      
		      I remember this as: \textbf{next term minus first term, divided by common ratio minus one.}
		      
		      A special case to keep in mind is when $|r| < 1$ and $n \to \infty$.
		      \begin{align*}

\newproblem{Including Images}{}
Include a picture of something interesting.

Learn how to include drawings in your documents with the \verb=\includegraphics{file}= command by submitting a picture of your favorite animal.
You should also look into the h, t, b, p and H placements. \verb|keepaspectratio| is also a useful option to know.
Play around with the \verb|height| and \verb|width| parameters.
You would want to know how to use them with \verb|\textheight| and \verb|\textwidth| in particular.
Other length units you should be aware of include \verb|em, ex, in, cm|.

\begin{solution}
	% Refer to earlier figures using \cref{...}. If you do not use the cleveref package (my template does), then you need to do Figure~\ref{...}.
	% The ... above should be replaced with the content inside the label below the \caption command.
